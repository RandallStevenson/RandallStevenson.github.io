        <h1>Latitude vs. Temperature</h1>
        <br>
        <br><h2>Description & Significance</h2><br>
A visual inspection of the plot of temperatures vs. latitude appears to indicate temperatures decrease with the radial distance from the equator.<br>
The curve is concave downward, which can often be modeled with a negative second degree polynomial or a sine or cosine function.<br>
It appears the cosine function would be a good candidate.<br>
<br>
<strong>Correlation: </strong>The correlation coefficient between the absolute value of the latitude and the temperature is <strong><color=red>-0.874</color></strong>.<br>
The correlation coefficient between the temperature and the cosine of the latitude is <strong><color=blue>0.894</color></strong>.<br>
These indicate a strong correlation between temperature and latitude, with the cosine of the latitude being the better candidate.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> There are more points above 0 degrees latitude than below.<br> 
This is expected, because a larger portion of the southern hemisphere is ocean.<br>
