        <h1>Latitude vs. Temperature</h1>
        <br>
        <br><h2>Description & Significance</h2><br>
A visual inspection of the plot of temperatures vs. latitude appears to indicate temperatures decrease with the radial distance from the equator.
The curve is concave downward, which can often be modeled with a negative second degree polynomial or a sine or cosine function.<br>
It appears the cosine function would be a good candidate.<br>
<br>
<strong>Correlation: </strong>The correlation coefficient between the absolute value of the latitude and the temperature is -0.874.<br>
The correlation coefficient between the temperature and teh cosine of the latitude is 0.894.<br>
These indicate a strong correlation between temperature and latitude, with the cosine of the latitude being the better candidate.<br>
