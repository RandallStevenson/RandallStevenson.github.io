    <h1>Latitude vs. Wind Speed</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Description & Significance</h2>
    <br>
    Although it may not be apparent from visual inspection, wind speeds tend to increase as one gets further from the equator.<br>
    The correlation coefficient between wind and absolute value of latitude in our data was <strong><color=blue>0.207</color></strong>.<br>
    The wind speeds are significantly affected by temperature gradients, since hotter air rises and colder air drops.<br>
    The greatest gradients occur further from the equator, producing stronger winds.<br>
