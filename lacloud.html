    <h1>Latitude vs. Cloud Cover</h1>
    <br>
    <br><h2>Description & Significance</h2><br>
    <br>
    Like humidity there is a slight trend toward increasing cloud cover as one goes to the north<br>
    in both the southern and northern hemispheres. The corrrelation between cloud cover and latitude is<br>
    negligible at <strong><color=blue>0.025</color></strong>. 

    <strong>Note: </strong>The concentration of plots at cloud cover percentages 20%, 40%, 75% and 90%<br>
    are indicative of the lack of precision in measuring cloud cover. <br><br>
