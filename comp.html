        <h3>Statistical Method #1</h3><br><br>
        We will test to see if there is a signficant difference in the temperatures within and beyond 45 degrees latitude from the equator.
        <br><br><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The temperature more than 45 degrees latitude from the equator is less than the temperature within 45 degrees latitude of the equator.  μ 45+ is less than μ 45-
        <br><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> Temperature more than 45 degrees latitude from the equator is greater than or equal to the temperature within 45 degrees latitude of the equator. μ 45+ ≥ μ 45-
        <br><strong>Significance Level:</strong> 1%.  
        <br><strong>Test Method:</strong> One-tailed, two-sample t-test
        <br><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong>

        <br>SE (standard error) = √{[( S245+ (n45+-1) + S245- (n45--1))/( n45+ + n45- -2)][1/ n45+  + 1/ n45+]}= 1.579
        <br>DF (degrees of freedom) = ( S245+/ n45+ + S245-/ n45-)2/{[( S245+/ n45+ )2/(n45+-1)]+ [( S245-/ n45- )2/(n45--1)]} = 235
        <br><br><strong>Test Statistic:</strong> t = (ẋ45+ - ẋ45-)/SE = -31.91
        <br><strong>P-value:</strong> The p-value is less than 0.00001. 
        <br><br><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Reject the null hypothesis. Based on the data provided there is a greater than 99.999% chance that the temperature more than 45 degrees latitude from the equator is less than the temperature within 45 degrees of the equator.
        <br>
        <h3>Statistical Method #2</h3><br><br>
        We will test the fit of temperature as a function of cosine of latitude to temperture being a constant.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The temperature is a function of latitude approximated by -44.7+125.3×cos(lat).
<strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> The temperature is independent of the cosine of the latitude.
<strong>Significance level:</strong> 1%
<strong>Test Method:</strong> Fisher’s F-test 
<strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong>  Let y = -44.7+125.3×cos(lat)<br>
	SSEx (sum of squares of errors for constant assumption) =896866.5<br>
	SSEy (sum of squares of errors for ys) = 90346.93<br>
	DF = 564 (use 120 in the F-table, for conservatism) <br><br>
    <strong>Test Statistic:</strong> F=(SSEx – SSEy)/( SSEy/564) = 5034.7<br>
    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> To pass the F-test at a 1% significance, F must be greater than 1.533, which it does. Therefore, we are at least 99% certain the model -44.7 + 125.3 x cos(latitude) for temperature is more accurate than assuming the temperature is 53.8 regardless of latitude. [Note: By further F-tests, a linear regression to the absolute value of the latitude also passes the F-test at 99% certainty,<br>
    but the cosine model is at least 99% likely to be a better model than the linear regression model.]<br>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
The temperature on the earth decreases as the distance from the equator increases. The average temperature (°F) at a latitude can be approximated by -44.7 + 125.3  × cos(latitude).
