    <h1>Latitude vs. Humidity</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Description & Significance</h2>
    <br>
    A visual inspection of the humidity vs. latitude doe not reveal any obvious connections.<br>
    The correlation coefficient between these is <strong><color=blue>0.095</color></strong>.
    When the humidity vs. latitude is considered separately for the northern and southern hemispheres,<br>
    the humidity tends to increase as one proceeds north in both hemispheres.<br>
    This is probably due to the distribution of climates, particularly desserts.<br>
